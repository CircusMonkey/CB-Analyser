# CB Analyser

## Intro
Developing a small portable prototype circuit breaker testing system.
The project is divided into 3 sections:
* Hardware
* Firmware
* Software

## Functional requirements
* Sensing the start of trip/close command
* 3 x individual pole timing and discrepancy of each pole.
* Contact bounce recording.
* Computer software to record data.

## Roadmap
* Initiate trip and close from module (push button or software).
* Trip and close coil current recording.
* Accelerometer with magnetic attachment to record mechanical contact bounce.
